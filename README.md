# Coding Quiz!

## Initial notes
This was a rough one for me. Took a lot longer than I expected. Setting up the information on the page was a breeze, and the timer went fairly smoothly, but I struggled for a while with the functions that displayed each question and removed the previous, while logging the answer. Showing the scores on a separate page also took more thought than I thought it would.

## Functionality
In the end, I got it fully functional! The only thing I think I could make work better is the 'Correct!'/'Incorrect' text that appears after you answer a question.

## Appearance
I'm very aware that the CSS has a long way to go. It pretty much looks like hot garbage at the moment. Everything seems to be working well, though, so I figured I'd submit and move on. (Also the assignment didn't exactly list making it pretty as a requirement)

## Organization
I'm no expert, but I'm pretty sure my code is a mess. I'm sure I could go through and reorganize the functions, visually as well as in regards to what purpose they serve. I stopped adding comments early on, which added to the disorganization. I purposefully left a couple in, though, for references to things I tried/want to try in a different setting.
